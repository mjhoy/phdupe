jkd-database-setup SEARCH_DIR OUTPUT_DIR [options]

This is a simple script that walks through a given search directory, finds all 
jpg files, and copies them to the output directory, mirroring their directory 
structure. 

If the -e option is given, the script assumes all jpgs will be in a subdirectory 
"export" in the search directory, and will NOT mirror this in the output: in 
other words, jpgs will move one level up from "export". This is to allow
Lightroom its "export into original folder" option to use a subdirectory.

options:

-e    look for jpgs within a directory named "export" and do not copy this
      subdirectory structure on output.
